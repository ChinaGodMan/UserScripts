# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! To help you get started with contributing code or documentation, we've put together the following guidelines. Please read them carefully before submitting code or issues.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Submitting an Issue

If you find a bug, need a new feature, or have improvement suggestions, please submit an issue via [Issues](https://github.com/ChinaGodMan/UserScripts/issues). Try to provide as much detail as possible, including:

-   A description of the problem
-   Steps to reproduce
-   Expected vs. actual results
-   System and environment information

### 2. Branching and Pull Request Workflow

#### Steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Create a branch**: In your forked repository, create a new branch. Use a clear and concise branch name, like `fix-bug-123` or `feature-new-function`.

3. **Write your code**: Develop, fix bugs, or add new features on this branch. Make sure to follow the project's coding style.

4. **Test your code**: Ensure that your code passes all relevant tests. If applicable, add tests for new features.

5. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes to your branch and push them to your forked repository.

6. **Open a Pull Request**: In your forked repository, click the "New Pull Request" button, select your branch, and create a Pull Request. In the description, clearly explain the changes you’ve made.

#### Pull Request Guidelines:

-   Ensure that your code is readable and clean. Avoid large-scale changes in a single commit.
-   Each Pull Request should focus on addressing a single issue or feature.
-   Reference the issue number in the description (if applicable).
-   We will review your Pull Request and provide feedback. Please be patient.

### 3. Code Style Guide

To maintain consistency across the project, please follow these coding style guidelines:

-   Ensure your code is readable and concise.
-   Use meaningful variable and function names, and separate words with underscores (e.g., `my_function`).
-   Keep functions and methods short, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
-   Follow the formatting rules set by any tools in the project (such as `Prettier`, `ESLint`, etc.).

### 4. Contributing to Documentation

If you find errors or unclear parts in the documentation, feel free to edit and submit a Pull Request. Contributing to documentation follows the same workflow as contributing to code.

## Thank You for Your Contributions

Whether you're filing an issue, fixing bugs, or contributing code and documentation, your help is greatly appreciated! We look forward to your contributions!
